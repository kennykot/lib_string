# lib_string
Implementation of the string.h library with additions on language C.

The string.h library is the main C library for string processing.
As part of the project youâ€™ll work on tasks with string data and consolidate the structured approach.

The C programming language has a set of functions implementing operations on strings (character strings and byte strings) in its standard library.
Various operations, such as copying, concatenation, tokenization and searching are supported.
For character strings, the standard library uses the convention that strings are null-terminated:
a string of n characters is represented as an array of n + 1 elements, the last of which is a "NULL" character. The only support for strings in the programming language proper is that the compiler translates quoted string constants into null-terminated strings.

The project includes:
1. memchr, memcmp, memmove, memset, strcat, strncat, strchr, strcmp, strncmp, strcpy, strncpy, strerror, strlen, strpbrk, strrchr, strspn, strstr, strtok, tolower, toupper, insert, trim.
2. sprintf with specifiers "i, d, f, u, c, s, %, h, l, L" and flags "-, +, 0, space, width, precision".


The repository is updated from time to time.
